### Fonts
Currently using system fonts. To add Google Fonts, add to the `<head>`:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Spacing & Sizing
Media query breakpoints and sizes can be adjusted in the responsive sections of `styles.css`.
